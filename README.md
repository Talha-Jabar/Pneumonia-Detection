This repository contains a machine learning project on **Image Classification Using Transfer Learning**, where pre-trained deep learning models are fine-tuned to classify images into different categories.

## Project Overview
Transfer learning is a powerful technique that leverages pre-trained models on large datasets to perform new tasks with limited data. In this project, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is fine-tuned to classify images into specified categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be accessed from an external source (e.g., Kaggle) or provided locally. The dataset should be organized into separate folders for each class.

### Data Structure
- **train**: Directory containing training images categorized into subfolders by class.
- **validation**: Directory containing validation images categorized into subfolders by class.
- **test**: Directory containing test images categorized into subfolders by class.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd image-classification-transfer-learning
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Image_Classification_Transfer_Learning.ipynb
   ```
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Image resizing and normalization.
   - Data augmentation to improve model generalization.

2. **Model Training**:
   - A pre-trained model MobileNetV2 is loaded.
   - The top layers of the model are fine-tuned for the specific classification task.
   - The model is optimized using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Confusion matrix and sample predictions are visualized.

## Results
The notebook provides:
- Predicted labels for test images.
- Visualization of correctly and incorrectly classified samples.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with other pre-trained models and compare their performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to further enhance model accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a web application or mobile app.
